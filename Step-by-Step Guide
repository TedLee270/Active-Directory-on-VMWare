1) VMware Workstation Pro 17 was already installed on my laptop for my college courses such as Pentesting, Database Systems, User Interfaces, etc.

2) Then Google "Window Server Demo Download" and click on "Windows Server 2025 | Microsoft Evaluation Center". This will take you to the page where you can download the ISO file for both the server and client side.

3) We then download the Windows 11 Enterprise ISO file for the client side server.

4) Once the ISO files have been downloaded, we go over to VMWare in order to set up the Windows VMs, starting with the server side first.

5) Once you have set up the servers, check for any Windows updates for security purposes.

6) Once the updates are ready, complete the same steps for another server VM.

7) After setting up 2 Windows server VMs, complete the setup for the client side Windows 11 Enterprise.

8) After the completion of all Windows servers, I took a snapshot of each one in order to establish a baseline snapshot in case something goes severely wrong and I need to hard reset back to original settings. I took another snapshot of the server side VMs after configuration to establish a post-config baseline.

9) Set up the original Windows Server with a manual IPv4 address and gateway. Then rename the PC to DC1 to establish that server as the first domain controller.

10) Set up the second Windows server the same way we did with the first server to establish the second domain controller.
